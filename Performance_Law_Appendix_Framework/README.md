# README

Thank you for your interest in our work! In this directory, we provide the code for the following three frameworks:

1. **LightGCN**  
   We utilized the LightGCN code from the following GitHub repository:  
   [LightGCN-PyTorch](https://github.com/gusye1234/LightGCN-PyTorch)

2. **DiffuRec**  
   For the DiffuRec framework, we used the code from this repository:  
   [DiffuRec](https://github.com/WHUIR/DiffuRec)

3. **Mamba4Rec**  
   For the Mamba4Rec framework, we referred to and utilized the code from the following repository:  
   [Mamba4Rec](https://github.com/chengkai-liu/Mamba4Rec)
